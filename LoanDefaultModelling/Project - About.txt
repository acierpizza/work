Project Summary - Lending Club Data Analysis and Classification

The Lending Club Data Analysis and Classification project focuses on leveraging a dataset spanning 
2007 to 2011 from the peer-to-peer lending platform, Lending Club. The primary objective is to 
develop a classification model predicting the likelihood of loan repayment by potential borrowers. 
The project unfolds through distinct stages:

I. Data Processing:

- This crucial step involves comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing, laying the foundation 
for subsequent analyses.

II. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Thorough exploration of the dataset involves statistical tests like t-tests or Chi-square. 
Addressing specific questions, such as the relationship between FICO scores and loan repayment 
likelihood, correlation between credit age and default probability, and other key insights.

III. Feature Engineering:

- Introducing 20 new variables through feature engineering enhances the dataset, augmenting its 
predictive power and providing additional dimensions for analysis.

IV. Modeling:

- Data clustering is employed using a minimum of three methods to identify potential borrower segments, 
determining the optimal number of clusters.
- Training five distinct models, each utilizing a different algorithm, and evaluating their performance
using the AUROC score as a quality metric.
- Assessing the impact of data compression through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on model performance 
and comparing results.
- Constructing a final model with an AUROC score target of >= 80%, incorporating feature selection, 
cross-validation, parameter tuning, and addressing class imbalances.

This comprehensive approach ensures a thorough examination of the dataset, from preprocessing 
and exploration to advanced modeling techniques, ultimately culminating in a robust classification 
model for predicting loan repayment outcomes.
