Project 1 - SQL (Clothing Store Database):

The SQL project involves creating a database for a clothing store, incorporating tables for producers, products, orders, and customers. 
Foreign key relationships are established, and the tables are populated with sample data. Various SQL queries are then executed to retrieve, 
sort, and analyze information such as product details, average prices, order values, and the most frequently sold product.

Language: MySQL
Used Technologies: MySQL Workbench

Project 2 - Lending Club Data Analysis and Classification Model Development:

The Lending Club project focuses on analyzing data from the peer-to-peer lending platform spanning 2007 to 2011. The objective is to build 
a classification model predicting the likelihood of loan repayment. The project includes data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), 
feature engineering, and modeling stages. Notable analyses include exploring the relationship between FICO scores and loan repayment, assessing 
the impact of various factors on default probability, and ultimately constructing a final model with an AUROC score target of >= 80%.
